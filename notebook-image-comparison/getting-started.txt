# Getting Started: Image EXIF & Algorithm Analysis

This environment allows you to compare 'coin.jpg' and 'varroe.jpg' using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

## 1. Start the Environment
Run the following command in your terminal within this folder:

   docker-compose up --build

Wait for the build to finish. You will see logs indicating that Jupyter Lab is running.

## 2. Access the Notebook
1. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8888
2. In the left-hand sidebar, double-click on 'comparison.ipynb'.

## 3. Run the Analysis
1. Once the notebook is open, click the "Play" icon (Run) in the toolbar or press 'Shift + Enter' on your keyboard while the code cell is selected.
2. The script will:
   - Extract EXIF metadata (Camera, Date, Settings).
   - Extract Quantization Tables (These are the "fingerprints" of the JPEG compression algorithm).
   - Display a side-by-side comparison table.

## 4. Shutting Down
To stop the environment, press 'Ctrl + C' in your terminal and then run:

   docker-compose down
