Q. Come mai ad Andrea non funziona la Camera correttamente? (31 Ottobre 2025)

A. The root cause is almost certainly the enterprise security policy on the device blocking camera access.

    I've re-examined the logs, and there are clear indicators of enterprise software running:

    * 10-30 19:04:52.933 ... Start proc 12933:com.motorola.enterprise.adapter.service/...
    * 10-30 19:04:52.562 ... I MotoDevicePolicyManagerService: isSecureHardware()

    These log entries confirm that a Motorola-specific enterprise service is active on the device.

    Blocked API Call: When the com.camera1 app attempts to open the camera,
      the Android system checks with the DevicePolicyManager. The enterprise
      service has set a policy to block camera access, so the system denies
      the request.

    Application Hang (ANR): The way the com.camera1 app is written likely causes
      it to hang when the camera request is denied in this manner. Instead of receiving
      an immediate error, the call might be blocking the main thread, waiting for a
      camera that the policy will never allow it to access. This
      causes an "Application Not Responding" (ANR) error.

    System Kills the App: The log line isKilledByAm=true (Killed by Activity Manager)
      confirms the system is terminating the app because it has become unresponsive
      (the ANR).

    Camera Not Released: Because the app is killed abruptly, it never gets to run its cleanup code,
      including the camera.release() method. This leaves the camera in a bad state,
      which can cause the errors seen on subsequent launch attempts.
